      <h1>To get a little more serious, here are some projects I've worked on in the past:</h1>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="/images/food_waste__Copy_.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Food Desert Paper</b></a></li>
          <p>This is basically a cool research paper my friends and I wrote that investigates the
              rising problem of food waste and food insecurity (basically people don't have access to enough nutrition for healthy living).
              Using a bunch of math, and stalking datasets, we discovered that it was theoretically possible to repurpose food waste
              to feed the food-insecure population. A surprising fact: the food waste generated in Texas can actually be used
              to feed the State's entire food-insecure population! Just a rag-tag bunch of teenagers looking to create change...with math :D</p>
          <li><a href="https://roomr1.appspot.com/" target="_blank"><b>Roomr.</b></a></li>
          <p>My group's final project from Google CSSI 2019. Roomr is a social media platform for college students to find
              potential roommates. It has everything users need to connect with one another, from a friending system
              to a live-chat feature. This was an awesome project to build, especially given that everyone in my group
              basically had no web-development knowledge 3 weeks prior. We truly went big-brain on this one. Shoutout to Reeve,
              Zak, and Quinn :)</p>
