      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      
      <p>Just to explain my background...</p>
      <p>I am originally from Chicago! Well, a small suburb called Long Grove :p</p>
      <img src='/images/longgrove.jpg'>
      <figcaption>This is my hometown! Cozy</figcaption>

      <p>I currently attend Stanford University! I study computer science. Beep boop. I've also
          taken classes on philosophy, molecular gastronomy(read: foooood), and earth science!
      </p>
      <p>Outside of class, I really enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, badminton, and spikeball! I also occasionally
          find myself playing an unhealhty amount of League of Legends. Add me @gucci gan. When I'm not in the gym or the
          computer lounge, you'll probably find me exploring beaches(Big Sur, Half Moon Bay, etc.) and consuming good eats.
          Here are some pictures from the school year that describe me :D </p>
      
      <p>Now that I'm home, cooking and baking have become part of my everyday life. Anything from egg
          sandwiches (that I found on tiktok) to sweet cornbread, I'm whipping it up! And eating, of course.</p>
      
      <p>To get a little more serious, here are some projects I've worked on in the past:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="/images/food_waste__Copy_.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Food Desert Paper</b></a></li>
          <p>This is basically a cool research paper my friends and I wrote that investigates the
              rising problem of food waste and food insecurity (basically people don't have access to enough nutrition for healthy living).
              Using a bunch of math, and stalking datasets, we discovered that it was theoretically possible to repurpose food waste
              to feed the food-insecure population. A surprising fact: the food waste generated in Texas can actually be used
              to feed the State's entire food-insecure population! Just a rag-tag bunch of teenagers looking to create change...with math :D</p>
          <li><a href="https://roomr1.appspot.com/" target="_blank"><b>Roomr.</b></a></li>
          <p>My group's final project from Google CSSI 2019. Roomr is a social media platform for college students to find
              potential roommates. It has everything users need to connect with one another, from a friending system
              to a live-chat feature. This was an awesome project to build, especially given that everyone in my group
              basically had no web-development knowledge 3 weeks prior. We truly went big-brain on this one. Shoutout to Reeve,
              Zak, and Quinn :)</p>
