        <p>
          This is basically a cool research paper my friends and I wrote that investigates the
          rising problem of food waste and food insecurity (basically people don't have access to enough nutrition for healthy living).
          Using a bunch of math, and stalking datasets, we discovered that it was theoretically possible to repurpose food waste
          to feed the food-insecure population. A surprising fact: the food waste generated in Texas can actually be used
          to feed the State's entire food-insecure population! Just a rag-tag bunch of teenagers looking to create change...with math :D

        <p>
          My group's final project from Google CSSI 2019. Roomr is a social media platform for college students to find
          potential roommates. It has everything users need to connect with one another, from a friending system
          to a live-chat feature. This was an awesome project to build, especially given that everyone in my group
          basically had no web-development knowledge 3 weeks prior. We truly went big-brain on this one. Shoutout to Reeve,
          Zak, and Quinn :)
